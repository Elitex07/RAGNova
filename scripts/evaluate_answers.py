"""
Run the full gold-set (every T and N row of data/gold_set.json) through the real
RAG core, and print a side-by-side comparison for a human to rate.

Run with:  python scripts/evaluate_answers.py            (text only, the Chapter 10 behaviour)
           python scripts/evaluate_answers.py --images   (also search images, ADR-010/011)
           python scripts/evaluate_answers.py --images --image-rows
                                                         (also the text-to-image gold rows, as questions)
(after scripts/build_index.py, with `ollama serve` running)

docs/ROADMAP.md's own stated Ch10 evaluation bar is "10 test questions,
humans rate answers 1-5" — an answer's quality (is it actually correct,
readable, appropriately hedged) is a judgment call this script cannot make
for you, unlike Recall@5/MRR's pure numbers. What IS automatable is
running every question through the pipeline and laying the result out
next to what's expected, so rating it is a five-minute read instead of a
five-minute setup, per question. Same division of labour as
scripts/evaluate_retrieval.py: the script measures/formats, a human judges.
