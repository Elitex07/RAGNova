"""
An image attached to a question as something the model can answer from (2026-10-10).

Reproduced the day it was reported: two screenshots that were not in the corpus were
attached, Tesseract read 540 and 3539 characters from them, and the answer was still
"I don't have enough information", because the picture was used only as a search key
and its text was never shown to the model. An attachment is now one more numbered
context block, first, labelled as the user's attachment, never filtered. These tests
pin that, and the limits that go with it: a bounded share of the context window, the
question shown to the model as typed, and an honest line for a picture with no text.
