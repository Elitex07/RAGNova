"""
Text embedding — the one function every track eventually calls to turn a
string into the vector ChromaDB actually searches over.

Shared, joint-owned (Ch4 §1.3), not Track A-private: documents (Chapter 6)
and audio transcripts (Chapter 9, ADR-005 — transcripts are indexed as
*text*) both need the identical model and the identical normalization
choice. Putting it here once means both tracks' vectors are guaranteed
comparable, which matters a great deal more for an embedding model than it
would for an ordinary utility function — two chunks embedded by two
independently-instantiated copies of "the same" model, with different
normalization, would silently produce vectors that don't rank the way
either track expects.

    is what makes cosine similarity and (squared) Euclidean distance
    produce IDENTICAL rankings (docs/GLOSSARY.md's "Cosine similarity"

    it) — and it is also the input all-MiniLM-L6-v2 was trained to be

    would silently make results modestly worse and inconsistent with the
    metric this project has told itself, in its own docs, that it's using.
