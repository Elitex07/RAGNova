"""
The shared chunk schema — the interface contract every RAGNova pipeline codes against.

This module is the real implementation of the strawman sketched in
docs/chapters/ch04-timeline-and-team-split.md §4.3. It exists so that Track A
(text + RAG core), Track B (vision + audio), and Track C (interface) can be
built in parallel without agreeing on anything else.

Design rationale (see docs/decisions/adr-003-two-vector-collections.md and
docs/chapters/ch04-timeline-and-team-split.md §1.3, §1.6):

  - This is a plain @dataclass, not a Pydantic model. We chose this
    deliberately: dataclasses are in the Python standard library (no extra
    dependency, one less thing to `pip install` and one less thing to
    version-pin), and Chapter 0 §A.6.16 already taught this exact pattern.
    Pydantic gives you automatic runtime validation "for free," which is a
    real advantage for a larger team or a longer-lived project — but it is
    also a steeper learning curve for a beginner team, and it hides the
    validation logic inside a library instead of in code the team wrote and
    can read. We get the validation anyway, explicitly, via `validate_chunk()`
    below — which is also exactly what the Chapter 4 §1.6 contract test calls.
    If the team later wants Pydantic's automatic validation and JSON schema
    export, that is a reasonable future-work upgrade (note it as such, don't
    silently swap it in mid-project — that would violate the interface freeze
    this whole file exists to protect).

  - Every field a track needs is here because Chapter 4 §4.2 said a track
    needs it, not because it seemed like a good idea at implementation time.
    If you need a new field, that is an interface change — see the note at
    the bottom of this file before adding one.

class Chunk:
    """One retrievable, citable unit of content.

    A Chunk is produced once, at ingestion time, by exactly one pipeline
    (Track A for documents and — via transcription, ADR-005 — audio; Track B
    for images). It is stored in a ChromaDB collection and retrieved, unchanged,
    at query time. Provenance fields (source, modality, page, start_s/end_s)
    are what make citation possible (Ch1 §1.8) — they are set once at
    ingestion and never recomputed later.

    Required for every chunk, regardless of modality:
        chunk_id:        Unique identifier. Convention:
                          "<source_stem>__<location>__c<NNN>", e.g.
                          "notice_pdf__p2__c003" or "lecture3_mp3__t872__c001".
        source:           Path to the original file, relative to the project's
                          `data/` directory (e.g. "data/documents/notice.pdf").
        modality:         Which pipeline produced this chunk. Determines which
                          collection it lives in (see `default_collection`).
        text:             The retrievable, displayable content. For a
                          document chunk, the extracted passage. For an audio
                          chunk, the transcript segment. For an image record,
                          any OCR text found (may be empty string, never None
                          — see `validate_chunk`).
        embedding_model:  Which model produced this chunk's vector, e.g.
                          "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" or "ViT-B-32/laion2b_s34b_b79k".
                          Required so retrieval code never accidentally
                          compares vectors from different models (ADR-003).

    Modality-specific (populate the pair that applies; leave the rest None):
        page:             1-indexed page number. Documents only.
        start_s, end_s:   Segment boundaries in seconds. Audio only.
                          Invariant: start_s < end_s when both are set.
        bbox:             Optional (x0, y0, x1, y1) region on a page or
                          image, for future fine-grained citation. Rarely
                          populated in the initial implementation — present
                          in the schema now so adding it later is not an
                          interface change.

    Populated only at query time, never at ingestion (see the note above
    `score` below):
        score:            Similarity or fused rank score from retrieval.
                          None for a freshly-ingested chunk.

# This schema is the interface contract (Ch4 §1.3, §1.6). A field's NAME and
# TYPE are not any single track's to change unilaterally once another track
# is coding against it — that is exactly the kind of change Chapter 4 §1.7
# describes as expensive if it happens silently on Day 12 instead of being
# agreed on Day 5. If you need a new field:
#   1. Propose it in the team's sync channel (Ch4 §3.3) — not a silent edit.
#   2. Add it here with a clear docstring, matching the style above.
#   3. Add or extend the relevant fixture in tests/test_contract.py so the
#      contract test actually exercises it.
#   4. Tell the other two tracks it exists before you depend on it.
