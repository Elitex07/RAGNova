"""
The first real semantic search this project can run: embed a query string
with the same model and normalization used at ingestion, ask ChromaDB's
text_index for the nearest chunks, and hand back real Chunk objects with
`.score` populated.

This function is deliberately built to be reusable, not a one-off demo —
scripts/evaluate_retrieval.py calls it to measure Recall@5/MRR against
Chapter 6's gold-set rows, and Chapter 10's RAG core will call this same
function as its retrieval step, then add generation and citation
formatting on top. Chapter 5's schemas.py docstring says "Chapter 10's
retrieval code attaches [score]" — this IS that retrieval code; Chapter 10
is what orchestrates it into a full answer, not what reimplements it.

    `top_k` defaults to settings.TOP_K (Chapter 1 §1.10 / .env), so every
    caller doesn't have to independently decide and hardcode a number.

    Passes `query_embeddings=`, never `query_texts=`, to ChromaDB's
    `.query()`. This distinction matters more than it looks: `query_texts`
    would silently ask Chroma to embed the query with ITS OWN default
    embedding function (not necessarily the same model, or even the same
    weights of the same model, as embeddings.py uses) — comparing a query
    vector from one model against stored vectors from another produces
    numbers that look like similarity scores but aren't measuring anything
    coherent. Always embedding the query ourselves is what keeps every
    vector in this comparison coming from the same model (Chapter 7 §2.3's
    misconception check works through this failure mode concretely).
