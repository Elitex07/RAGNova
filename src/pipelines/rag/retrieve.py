Cross-modal retrieval: search text_index and image_index separately, gate
each on its own relevance floor, then merge the two lists by RANK
(ADR-007), never by raw score.

Chapter 10 searched text_index only (documents, and — once indexed —
audio transcripts, which live there too per ADR-005). This module is the
Chapter 12 piece that lets one question also surface images.

    Why rank, in one line: CLIP's text-to-image scores are lower than
    MiniLM's text-to-text scores *even for perfect matches* (the modality
    gap), so sorting by raw score would bury every image. Rank ignores
    the scale difference; the #1 image and the #1 document tie.

    stable), so with one text list and one image list the result reads

    ADR-007 names as the simplest acceptable form of rank merging.
